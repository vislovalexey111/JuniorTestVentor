# JuniorTestVentor
 A test project for a Junior C++ Developer at "Ventor" company

The task was:
1. We need to implement Queue class, using given class declaration.
2. When we creating a "Queue" object, the initial size must be specified.
3. Queue "hData" must be allocated as an inline memory block.
4. A "Head" variable must be an index of the first memory block.
5. A "Tail" must point to the end of data.
6. By calling "Put" function we must move the "Head"
5. By calling "Clear" function we must move the "Tail"
6. The Queue must be a "Cirlce Queue", so there must be overflow contorl system (if the "Head" will meet the "Tail")
